**Description of Assignment**
I added four shapes, rectangle, line, circle, and polygon (triangle) all in different colors, with the triangle having a black outline. The four circles on the bottom were generated using a test dataset which contains their x-values. There is a pink line on the left-side of the container which I created by setting the y-axis value to the height of the container and x-value to 0. The orange line on the bottom of the container was created by setting the x-value to the width of the container and y-value to 0. The black line was created by setting the x-value to the width and the y-value to the height. I created these several lines to figure out what positions and relations the x and y values have. To write this code, I started with the given starter code then used d3-graph-gallery.com to find code for the shapes. 

**Technical Achievements**
By using the selectAll and mouseover/mouseout functions I was able to make it so that if you hover over a circle shape, it changes the color to red, then when you move the mouse it changes the color to black. My plan was to try to make it so that if you mouseover it shows the x-value for the circles, but that proved to be much more complex than anticipated.
Another achievement was that I was able to generate a group of 4 circles using a dataset. This dataset contained four values which I used as the x-values for the circles. I believe that this feature will be important for future assignments when creating visuals based on actual datasets.
